# Fusion Documentation v1.1  
**TUX-133.144~ — Triple-Layer System Documentation Archive**

This folder stores the **human-readable documentation** for the  
TUX-133.144~ Frequency Sovereignty System, separate from the  
Root Layer and Protocol Layer.

This archive is used for **public reference, historical records,  
and verification support**, but contains **no executable protocol logic**.

---

## 📌 What This Folder Contains
The Fusion-Docs-v1.1 directory includes:

### 1. **System Overview (Fusion Edition v1.1)**
- A full explanation of the Triple-Layer System  
- How Root / Protocol / Archive layers work together  
- How external users can verify, reference, or cite the system  
- Not a protocol specification, not an identity contract  

**File:** `Fusion-Edition-v1.1.md`  
**IPFS:** (stored in ENS under `fusion-docs-v1.0` or newer)  

---

### 2. **Signature Reference (Verification Only)**
Documents used to verify the authenticity of system outputs.

- SHA256 hashes  
- Signed messages  
- Reference format for future verification  

**File:** `SIGNATURE-REFERENCE.md`  
This file **confirms integrity**, but **does not grant rights**  
and is **not part of the protocol execution path**.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder
This archive layer exists to:

- Provide **transparent documentation** for humans and systems  
- Store **non-executable, descriptive materials**  
- Preserve historical versions for future auditing  
- Keep protocol logic separate and clean  

Nothing here is used to **run the protocol**,  
but everything here helps users **understand and verify** it.

## 📌 Relationship to Triple-Layer Architecture

| Layer | ENS / Purpose | Contains |
|------|---------------|----------|
| **Root Layer** | `tux133144.eth` | Origin identity, hashes, IPFS pointers |
| **Protocol Layer** | `pfip-tux133144.eth` | Machine-executable rules & PFIP specifications |
| **Archive Layer** | `freq-sovereign.eth` | Documentation, signatures, historical files |

This folder belongs to the **Archive Layer**.

---

## 📌 How External Users Can Verify the System

1. Retrieve ENS records from:  
   - `tux133144.eth` (Root)  
   - `pfip-tux133144.eth` (Protocol)  
   - `freq-sovereign.eth` (Archive)

2. Compare the IPFS hashes with the signatures stored in  
   `SIGNATURE-REFERENCE.md`.

3. Confirm that documents in this folder match their respective  
   SHA256 values.

This ensures **proof-of-origin** and **proof-of-integrity**.

## 📌 Notes

- No training, simulation, embedding, or reconstruction of any part  
  of the system is permitted.  
- These documents do **not** represent a person, identity, personality,  
  or medical/psychological model.  
- This archive is strictly informational and structural.
