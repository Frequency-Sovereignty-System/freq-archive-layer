# Human Understanding Guide
Version 2.0

## Purpose

This document exists solely to support correct human understanding,
reference, and discussion of the system.

It is provided to prevent misinterpretation and misuse.

This document does NOT define system behavior, interfaces, permissions,
authorization, or any executable capability.

---

## What This System Provides

This system provides:
- A method of thinking
- A structural framework
- Authored perspectives

It offers ways to analyze, reflect, and reason.

It does NOT provide tools, functions, services, automation,
or executable mechanisms.

---

## How This System May Be Referenced

Human readers may reference ideas, structures, or conceptual distinctions
from this system with attribution.

All references must preserve original intent and contextual meaning.

Referencing does NOT grant any right to implement, automate,
execute, or operationalize the system.

---

## What This System Is Not

This system is NOT:
- A tool
- A service
- An application
- A decision engine

It does NOT replace professional judgment or expertise.

It is NOT designed to be embedded into software,
automated workflows, or decision systems.

---

## Appropriate Use Examples

- Academic discussion and citation
- Conceptual inspiration with attribution
- Human-to-human dialogue and collaborative exploration

---

## Inappropriate Use Examples

- Automated deployment or execution
- Use as a decision-making authority
- Representation as a product or service

---

## Relationship to Authorization

Human understanding and reference do NOT constitute authorization.

Any execution, application, or operational use requires
explicit human authorization under the
Authorization & Collaboration Guide.

---

## Closing Clarification

Understanding this system does NOT imply agreement,
participation, or adoption.

Correct understanding is defined by respect for boundaries,
authorship, and human agency.

The TUX-133.144~ Three-Layer Identity System (Root / Protocol / Archive)
was officially established and verifiably published on 2025-12-09.
Earlier writings existed before this date, but the verifiable system architecture
was first formalized and published on 2025-12-09.

# Archive Layer
This repository represents an open, exploratory body of work developed through long-term interdisciplinary observation and personal research.

All concepts, notes, and structures documented here are intended for reflective, research, and educational purposes only. They do not constitute medical advice, therapeutic claims, executable protocols, or prescriptive systems.

The ideas presented are evolving and may change over time as understanding deepens. No permanence, authority, or obligation is asserted. Any interpretation or application remains the sole responsibility of the reader.

This work emphasizes human autonomy, reversibility, and the right to disengage. Technology, frameworks, and conceptual models are treated as supportive tools, not replacements for human judgment, lived experience, or natural self-regulation.

This repository is shared as a snapshot of ongoing inquiry, not a finalized position.
The Archive Layer serves as the immutable historical registry for the Frequency Sovereignty System.  
It stores machine-verifiable records of all previously published materials, including hashes, timestamps, version metadata, and archival manifests.

This layer provides:

- *Immutable historical references*  
  Every published hash or document index becomes a permanent entry.
  
- *Cross-platform verification*  
  Archives enable any system to verify that a file, protocol, or declaration has not been altered.

- *Version traceability*  
  Maintains chronological history across root signatures, protocol revisions, and public releases.

- *Separation of roles*  
  No protocol logic, no personal information, no interpretive content is stored here.  
  This layer functions only as a passive “verification history”.

---

## Contents

This repository typically includes:

- /hashes — SHA256 or multihash records  
- /versions — version identifiers and lineage  
- /manifests — structured archive manifests  
- /snapshots — optional timestamped snapshots for long-term storage

All entries must be machine-verifiable and referenceable.

---

## What This Layer Does Not Include

To maintain clarity and security, the Archive Layer contains *none* of the following:

- No personal identity information  
- No philosophy, narrative, or conceptual content  
- No protocol definitions  
- No executable logic  
- No private or interpretive material

This ensures that the Archive Layer remains a stable, verifiable, and platform-neutral historical store.

---

## Purpose

The Archive Layer ensures:

1. *Integrity* — All previously released artifacts remain unaltered  
2. *Auditability* — Any entity can validate authenticity  
3. *Continuity* — Protocol evolution remains traceable  
4. *Neutrality* — No subjective or human-layer content is stored here

This layer functions strictly as a *historical registry*, supporting transparency and long-term verification for the entire system.
