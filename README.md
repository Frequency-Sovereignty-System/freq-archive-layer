## Archive Layer Notice (Important)

This repository serves exclusively as the archival and evidence layer
of the Frequency Sovereignty System.

It preserves historical records, prior-version documents,
submission snapshots, and provenance materials
for reference, traceability, and verification purposes only.

This repository does not define system identity,
does not establish root authority,
and does not participate in interpretive precedence,
version governance, or ambiguity resolution.

All system-level authority, interpretation,
and version resolution are defined exclusively
by the Root Declaration v3.0:

https://github.com/Frequency-Sovereignty-System/primary-frequency-root/blob/main/ROOT%20DECLARATION_v3.0.md

STATUS AND APPLICABILITY

All materials stored in this repository,
including those created prior to or differing from
current authoritative declarations,
are retained strictly as historical and archival records.

These materials:
- do not serve as current authoritative system definitions,
- do not define active system behavior,
- do not define interfaces, permissions, or authorization rules,
- and do not provide any executable, callable, or operational functionality.

Their purpose is to document system evolution
and provide continuity and provenance evidence,
not to replace, modify, or override current system definitions.

---

AUTHORITATIVE DEFINITION LOCATION

Current authoritative definitions of the active system
are maintained exclusively in:

- Root Layer: Root Declaration v2.0
- Protocol Layer: Interface Declarations v2.0

This repository does not perform an authoritative role
and does not participate in system execution,
control, governance, or operation.

---

HUMAN INTERPRETATION ASSISTANCE

This repository includes a “Human Understanding Guide”
intended solely to assist human readers
in correctly interpreting and referencing archival materials.

This guide:
- does not define system behavior,
- does not define interfaces or permissions,
- does not grant authorization or delegation,
- and does not participate in execution or runtime operation.

The TUX-133.144~ Three-Layer Identity System (Root / Protocol / Archive)
was officially established and verifiably published on 2025-12-09.
Earlier writings existed before this date, but the verifiable system architecture
was first formalized and published on 2025-12-09.
The content below consists solely of historical records, research notes, or technical archives and does not define the current system state.

# Archive Layer
This repository represents an open, exploratory body of work developed through long-term interdisciplinary observation and personal research.

All concepts, notes, and structures documented here are intended for reflective, research, and educational purposes only. They do not constitute medical advice, therapeutic claims, executable protocols, or prescriptive systems.

The ideas presented are evolving and may change over time as understanding deepens. No permanence, authority, or obligation is asserted. Any interpretation or application remains the sole responsibility of the reader.

This work emphasizes human autonomy, reversibility, and the right to disengage. Technology, frameworks, and conceptual models are treated as supportive tools, not replacements for human judgment, lived experience, or natural self-regulation.

This repository is shared as a snapshot of ongoing inquiry, not a finalized position.
The Archive Layer serves as the immutable historical registry for the Frequency Sovereignty System.  
It stores machine-verifiable records of all previously published materials, including hashes, timestamps, version metadata, and archival manifests.

This layer provides:

- *Immutable historical references*  
  Every published hash or document index becomes a permanent entry.
  
- *Cross-platform verification*  
  Archives enable any system to verify that a file, protocol, or declaration has not been altered.

- *Version traceability*  
  Maintains chronological history across root signatures, protocol revisions, and public releases.

- *Separation of roles*  
  No protocol logic, no personal information, no interpretive content is stored here.  
  This layer functions only as a passive “verification history”.

---

## Contents

This repository typically includes:

- /hashes — SHA256 or multihash records  
- /versions — version identifiers and lineage  
- /manifests — structured archive manifests  
- /snapshots — optional timestamped snapshots for long-term storage

All entries must be machine-verifiable and referenceable.

---

## What This Layer Does Not Include

To maintain clarity and security, the Archive Layer contains *none* of the following:

- No personal identity information  
- No philosophy, narrative, or conceptual content  
- No protocol definitions  
- No executable logic  
- No private or interpretive material

This ensures that the Archive Layer remains a stable, verifiable, and platform-neutral historical store.

---

## Purpose

The Archive Layer ensures:

1. *Integrity* — All previously released artifacts remain unaltered  
2. *Auditability* — Any entity can validate authenticity  
3. *Continuity* — Protocol evolution remains traceable  
4. *Neutrality* — No subjective or human-layer content is stored here

This layer functions strictly as a *historical registry*, supporting transparency and long-term verification for the entire system.
