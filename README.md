# Archive Layer — Frequency Sovereignty System

## Current Status Notice (Important)

This repository serves as the **Archive and Evidentiary Layer** of the
Frequency Sovereignty System.

Its sole purpose is to preserve historical records, prior documents,
submission artifacts, and continuity evidence for **verification,
traceability, and reference**.

**This repository does NOT define:**
- Current system behavior
- Active interfaces
- Permissions or access rights
- Authorization rules
- Executable, callable, or operational system capabilities

Authoritative definitions of the active system are maintained in:
- **Root Layer** — Root Declaration v2.0
- **Protocol Layer** — Interface Declarations v2.0

---

## Human Understanding & Reference

This repository includes a document intended solely to support
**correct human understanding, reference, and discussion**:

- **HUMAN_UNDERSTANDING_GUIDE_v2.md**

This guide exists to clarify conceptual boundaries and authorship.
It does **not** grant authorization, execution rights, or permission
to apply, automate, or operationalize this system.

## System Establishment Timeline

The TUX-133.144~ Three-Layer Identity System
(Root / Protocol / Archive)
was formally established and verifiably published on **2025-12-09**.

Materials created prior to this date are preserved here as historical
records only and do **not** define the current system architecture.

---

## Historical Records (Non-Authoritative)

The following directories and files are preserved strictly for
historical continuity and research reference:

- `Fusion-Docs-v1.0/`
- `Fusion-Docs-v1.1/`
- `Historical-PFIP/`
- Early whitepapers, JSON files, and submission records
- Any documents labeled v1.x

**These materials:**
- Do not define current system state
- Carry no interface or authorization authority
- Must not be interpreted as active specifications

---

## Archive Layer Role Summary

The Archive Layer exists exclusively to:

- Preserve historical continuity
- Provide authorship and timestamp evidence
- Prevent misinterpretation of the system as a live product or service

This layer issues no instructions, enables no execution,
and performs no operational function.

## Archive Layer Notice (Important)

This repository serves as the archival and evidentiary layer of the
Frequency Sovereignty System.

It preserves historical records, prior documents, and submission artifacts
for continuity, verification, and reference purposes only.

This repository does NOT define current system behavior, authority,
interfaces, permissions, or operational rules.

The TUX-133.144~ Three-Layer Identity System (Root / Protocol / Archive)
was officially established and verifiably published on 2025-12-09.
Earlier writings existed before this date, but the verifiable system architecture
was first formalized and published on 2025-12-09.

# Archive Layer
This repository represents an open, exploratory body of work developed through long-term interdisciplinary observation and personal research.

All concepts, notes, and structures documented here are intended for reflective, research, and educational purposes only. They do not constitute medical advice, therapeutic claims, executable protocols, or prescriptive systems.

The ideas presented are evolving and may change over time as understanding deepens. No permanence, authority, or obligation is asserted. Any interpretation or application remains the sole responsibility of the reader.

This work emphasizes human autonomy, reversibility, and the right to disengage. Technology, frameworks, and conceptual models are treated as supportive tools, not replacements for human judgment, lived experience, or natural self-regulation.

This repository is shared as a snapshot of ongoing inquiry, not a finalized position.
The Archive Layer serves as the immutable historical registry for the Frequency Sovereignty System.  
It stores machine-verifiable records of all previously published materials, including hashes, timestamps, version metadata, and archival manifests.

This layer provides:

- *Immutable historical references*  
  Every published hash or document index becomes a permanent entry.
  
- *Cross-platform verification*  
  Archives enable any system to verify that a file, protocol, or declaration has not been altered.

- *Version traceability*  
  Maintains chronological history across root signatures, protocol revisions, and public releases.

- *Separation of roles*  
  No protocol logic, no personal information, no interpretive content is stored here.  
  This layer functions only as a passive “verification history”.

---

## Contents

This repository typically includes:

- /hashes — SHA256 or multihash records  
- /versions — version identifiers and lineage  
- /manifests — structured archive manifests  
- /snapshots — optional timestamped snapshots for long-term storage

All entries must be machine-verifiable and referenceable.

---

## What This Layer Does Not Include

To maintain clarity and security, the Archive Layer contains *none* of the following:

- No personal identity information  
- No philosophy, narrative, or conceptual content  
- No protocol definitions  
- No executable logic  
- No private or interpretive material

This ensures that the Archive Layer remains a stable, verifiable, and platform-neutral historical store.

---

## Purpose

The Archive Layer ensures:

1. *Integrity* — All previously released artifacts remain unaltered  
2. *Auditability* — Any entity can validate authenticity  
3. *Continuity* — Protocol evolution remains traceable  
4. *Neutrality* — No subjective or human-layer content is stored here

This layer functions strictly as a *historical registry*, supporting transparency and long-term verification for the entire system.
